We redesigned our video player to improve the look and feel as well as to bring new features to you. The new video player supports subtitles, picture-in-picture mode and playback via AirPlay. To access the subtitles in offline mode, you have to redownload the respective videos.

Further small improvements:
â€¢ Dynamic type support for text items
