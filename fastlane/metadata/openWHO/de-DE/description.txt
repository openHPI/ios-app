Designed primarily for health care workers, frontline responders, and decision-makers, the app is also a source of information for those affected by infectious hazards, or for those with general interest in WHO's work in health emergencies.

It features 4 channels:
The Outbreak Channel addresses the management of infectious diseases and provides life-saving, scientific information.
The Ready for Response channel prepares personnel to be deployed to work in disease outbreaks and health emergencies.
The Get Social channel focuses on social sciences based interventions and helps to communicate with affected communities.
The GOARN channel is dedicated to preparing the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network for international alert and response operations.

Most of the courses are in English, but other language versions are in the pipeline. Check out this app, come back regularly and get engaged in the OpenWHO community.
