# Programming guidelines

### Fastlane
We use [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) for repetitive tasks. Have a look at the [fastlane README](fastlane/README.md).

### Code formatting
In order to have a consistent code formatting, we would like you to set some settings:
- for less unneccessary whitespace changes please set both checkboxes in Xcode->Preferences->Text Editing regarding whitespaces
- use Unix-style line endings (LF)

### R.swift
We use [R.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift) to keep a certain level of code quality. The linter will run for every pull request and there is also a fastlane command for this.

#### Using self
One thing we can't enforce with R.swift is not to omit `self`. We prefer writing `self` explicitly because we believe this helps to distinguish between member attributes and local variabels.

### Localization
We use [BartyCrouch](https://github.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch) to ensure a complete localization of the applications. Simple run `bundle exec fastlane localize` to add entries for missing localizations in storyboard files and `NSLocalizedString` usages. Here are some tips to promote a consistent usage:

#### Exlusion of storyboard elements
Add `#bc-ignore!` to 'Comment For Localizer' box in the utilities pane instead of adding `#bc-ignore!` to the elements value.
<div>
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch/stable/Images/IB-Comment-Exclusion-Example1.png" width="255px" height="437px">
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch/stable/Images/IB-Comment-Exclusion-Example2.png" width="254px" height="140px">
</div>

#### Support of stringsdict files
Add `#bc-ignore!` to the user comment of `NSLocalizedString`
```
let format = NSLocalizedString("%d hours", comment: "<number> of hours #bc-ignore!")
```

#### Use name-spaced keys for NSLocalizedString
To add more context to single localized strings, we use name-spaced keys instead of the english text. The english text is stored in `Localizable.strings (Base)`. In this way we also avoid unneccesary long localization keys. So, we write:
```swift
NSLocalizedString("course.section-title.my courses", comment: ...)
```
instead of
```swift
NSLocalizedString("My Courses", comment: ...)
```

# How to publish a new version fo the apps
You have to be part of out core dev team to do this.

### Prerequirements:
- Configure fastlane
    - make your own Appfile via `cp fastlane/Appfile.dummy fastlane/Appfile`
    - set the following values
        - `apple_id`
        - `itunes_connect_id`
    - for all available fastlane commands have a look at the [fastlane Readme](https://github.com/openHPI/xikolo-ios/tree/master/fastlane/)
- Unlock the configuration files
  - Install git-crypt via `brew install git-crypt`
  - Retrieve the `xikolo-ios.key` from the openHPI team and run `git-crypt unlock   /path/to/xikolo-ios.key`

### Release the apps
There is a fastlane command for each step. One for all flavor and one for each flavor (suffix: `_flavorname`)

1. Retrieve the iOS Distribution Certificate (in person) and the Provisioning Profiles (via Xcode, you must be part of our development team)
1. Update metadata (especially the release notes) in `fastlane/metadata` (fastlane will create a new version in iTunesConnect)
1. Optional: Create app screenshots via `fastlane make_screenshots`
1. Upload metadata via `fastlane upload_metadata`
1. Optional: Upload screenshots via `fastlane upload_screenschots`
1. Upload IPA via `fastlane release`
1. Wait until iTunesConnect has processed the build
1. Assign the build to the release manually
1. Submit the release to review manually
1. Create a github release (incl. git tag) for the release via `fastlane tag_release`
1. Refresh the dSYM files on Firebase for the current app version via `fastlane refresh_dsyms`
